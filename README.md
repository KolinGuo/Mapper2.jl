Welcome to the Mapper2 project. This program was originally intended to serve
as a CAD tool for application development for the KiloCore and KiloCore2
many-core processors, and has since morphed into a more generalized mapping
tool allowing flexible, high speed mappings to arbitrary topologies in arbitrary
dimensions. This is still a work in progress, but has matured over the last couple of months.
